/// SQLx-based implementation of the ArticleRepository trait
///
/// This struct provides PostgreSQL database access for article operations using
/// the SQLx async database library. It implements the ArticleRepository trait
/// defined in the domain layer, following the Repository pattern and Dependency
/// Inversion Principle.
///
/// # Architecture
///
/// This implementation sits in the infrastructure layer and provides concrete
/// database operations while the trait definition remains in the domain layer.
/// This allows the domain and application layers to remain independent of
/// specific database technologies.
///
/// # Database Schema
///
/// This repository expects the following table structure:
///
/// ```sql
/// CREATE TABLE articles (
///     id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
///     title TEXT NOT NULL,
///     tags TEXT[] NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
///     category TEXT NOT NULL,
///     summary TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
///     content TEXT NOT NULL,
///     status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'draft',
///     created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
///     updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
/// );
/// ```
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use sqlx::PgPool;
/// use backend::infrastructure::db::sqlx_repo::SqlxArticleRepository;
///
/// let pool = PgPool::connect("postgres://...").await?;
/// let repo = SqlxArticleRepository::new(pool);
/// ```
pub struct SqlxArticleRepository {

    /// across multiple requests, improving performance and resource utilization.
